# appman

I'm building this linux app manager application because I always have ideas for customizations and creating applications to improve my linux experience and there is always this one obstacle, of I need it to start this application when I login. And instead of just enabling into systemclt every individual apps I may create so that it launches at startup. Having an app manager handle this to seamlessly activate/deactivate/install/uninstall apps and tweak app settings, in a centralized manner to have more control, will be very convenient.
